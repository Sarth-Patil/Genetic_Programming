# "Survival of the fittest" - Darwinian evolutionary theory

Components of GA  

## Population  
Set of all possible solutions,a population has Chromosomes which consists of genes (genes are encoded in a chromosome).  
Chromosomes - solutions.  
Genes - parameters

## Selection  
Population of solutions associated with fitness score by applying fitness function.  

## Crossover  
crossing over parents to create new population.

## Mutation  
Adding better traits, genes which were not inherited from parents
